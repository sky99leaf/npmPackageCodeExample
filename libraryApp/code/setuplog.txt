this is old does not include webpack stuff

created new package.json using "npx create-react-app my-app"
   in junk folder and copied here
Then added:
npm install jsonpath
npm install yargs
npm install fs
npm i css-loader
.. and more

looked in node_modules and babel and webpack are already there 
I assume they put there by create-react-app

added webpack.config.js
from https://webpack.js.org/
// https://medium.com/@ns-tech-learn/how-to-install-webpack-and-configure-in-react-js-88b4b0bd0af9
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server

./node_modules/.bin/webpack -mode development

get error: "Support for the experimental syntax 'jsx' isn't currently enabled"
get this when .babelrc is not there.
